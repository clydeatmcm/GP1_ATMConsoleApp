# Guided Project 1 - ATM Console App (Procedural)
By completing this guided project, 
- [ ] Gain hands-on experience creating a working ATM Console App with C#, from setting up the project to managing menus.
- [ ] Populate demo cardholders and build key ATM features, like checking balances, depositing and withdrawing cash, and tracking transactions.
- [ ] Improve their skills in designing user interfaces, managing data, and handling user interactions, gaining a solid understanding of procedural programming and app development in C#.

### Problem Statement
Create a C# console application that simulates an ATM. The app should include a main menu to insert a card or exit, and a secure menu for balance checks, cash deposits, withdrawals, and transaction viewing. Populate the system with demo cardholders with card numbers, PINs, names, and balances. Users should be able to check their balance, deposit and withdraw money, and view recent transactions. Ensure the application handles user credentials securely and updates balances accurately.

### Here are the requirements for the ATM Console App:
- [ ] Create a new C# console application.
- [ ] Show a main menu and a secure menu for user options.
- [ ] Add demo cardholders with card numbers, PINs, names, and balances.
- [ ] Allow users to check their account balance.
- [ ] Enable users to deposit money into their account.
- [ ] Allow users to withdraw money from their account.
- [ ] Show a list of recent transactions.
