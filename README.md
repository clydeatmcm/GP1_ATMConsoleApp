### Done. 🚀 Congratulations! - Try this challenges and collect 10 trophies 🏆.

- [ ] 🏆 GP1_Challenge1. **Limit PIN Attempts:** Limit the cardholders to enter their PIN a maximum of three times. If the user fails to enter the correct PIN within three attempts, the account should be locked, and the user should not be able to try again until a predefined time has passed.

- [ ] 🏆 🏆 GP1_Challenge2. **Implement Transaction History:** Add functionality to keep track of each transaction (deposit, withdrawal) along with the date and time. Display the last 5 transactions in the "Transactions" menu.

- [ ] 🏆 🏆 GP1_Challenge3. **Daily Withdrawal Limit:** Introduce a daily withdrawal limit for each cardholder. This limit should reset every 24 hours. If the user exceeds this limit, they should be informed and prevented from withdrawing more funds that day.

- [ ] 🏆 🏆 GP1_Challenge4. **Add a Card PIN Change Feature:** Provide a menu option for users to change their PIN after successfully logging in. The new PIN should be verified by re-entering it, and there should be checks to prevent simple or easily guessed PINs.

- [ ] 🏆 🏆 🏆 GP1_Challenge5. **Account Statement Generation:** Add a feature that allows users to generate and view account statements for a specified period. Users should be able to select a date range and receive a summary of all transactions (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) within that period. The statement can be displayed on the screen or saved to a file for future reference.
