# Guided Project 1 - ATM Console App (Procedural)
By completing this guided project, 
- [ ] Learners will gain practical experience in developing a functional ATM Console Application using C#. The project will guide them through the entire development process, starting with setting up the project environment and managing menu displays.
- [ ] Learners will populate demo cardholders to simulate real-world data and implement essential ATM functionalities, including balance enquiry, cash deposits, withdrawals, and transaction tracking.
- [ ] Learners will enhance their skills in user interface design, data management, and handling user interactions, thereby building a comprehensive understanding of procedural programming and application development in C#.
